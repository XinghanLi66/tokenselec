How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] To determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we need to identify the values of \( x \) that make the denominator equal to zero. These values will give us the locations of the vertical asymptotes.

The steps are as follows:

1. Factor the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 \).
2. Set the factored denominator equal to zero and solve for \( x \).
3. Count the number of distinct solutions to determine the number of vertical asymptotes.

Let's proceed with the Python code to perform these steps.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Define the denominator
denominator = x**2 + x - 6

# Factor the denominator
factored_denominator = sp.factor(denominator)

# Solve for x when the denominator is zero
vertical_asymptotes = sp.solve(factored_denominator, x)

# Count the number of distinct solutions
num_vertical_asymptotes = len(vertical_asymptotes)

# Print the result
print(num_vertical_asymptotes)
```
```output
2
```
The number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) is \(\boxed{2}\).

If $a,b,c,d$ are positive real numbers such that $a,b,c,d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence and $a,b,d$ form a geometric sequence, then find the value of $\dfrac{a}{d}.$ Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define the Arithmetic Sequence:**
   Since \(a, b, c, d\) form an arithmetic sequence, we can write:
   \[
   b = a + d_1, \quad c = a + 2d_1, \quad d = a + 3d_1
   \]
   where \(d_1\) is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.

2. **Define the Geometric Sequence:**
   Since \(a, b, d\) form a geometric sequence, we can write:
   \[
   b^2 = ad
   \]
   Substituting \(b = a + d_1\) and \(d = a + 3d_1\) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   (a + d_1)^2 = a(a + 3d_1)
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying, we get:
   \[
   a^2 + 2ad_1 + d_1^2 = a^2 + 3ad_1
   \]
   \[
   d_1^2 = ad_1
   \]
   Since \(d_1 \neq 0\) (because \(a, b, c, d\) are positive real numbers), we can divide both sides by \(d_1\):
   \[
   d_1 = a
   \]
   So, the common difference \(d_1\) is equal to \(a\).

3. **Find the Value of \(\frac{a}{d}\):**
   Since \(d = a + 3d_1\) and \(d_1 = a\), we have:
   \[
   d = a + 3a = 4a
   \]
   Therefore, the value of \(\frac{a}{d}\) is:
   \[
   \frac{a}{d} = \frac{a}{4a} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

Let's confirm this with Python code to ensure the result is accurate.
```python
# Let's define the variables and solve the equations step by step using Python

# Since a, b, c, d form an arithmetic sequence, we can write:
# b = a + d1, c = a + 2d1, d = a + 3d1
# Since a, b, d form a geometric sequence, we can write:
# b^2 = ad

# Substituting b = a + d1 and d = a + 3d1 into the geometric sequence equation:
# (a + d1)^2 = a(a + 3d1)
# Expanding and simplifying:
# a^2 + 2ad1 + d1^2 = a^2 + 3ad1
# d1^2 = ad1
# Since d1 != 0, we can divide both sides by d1:
# d1 = a

# So, the common difference d1 is equal to a.
# Therefore, d = a + 3d1 = a + 3a = 4a
# The value of a/d is:
# a/d = a/(4a) = 1/4

# Let's confirm this with a simple calculation
a = 1  # We can assume a to be any positive real number, let's assume a = 1 for simplicity
d = 4 * a  # Since d = 4a
a_over_d = a / d  # The value of a/d

print(a_over_d)
```
```output
0.25
```
The value of \(\frac{a}{d}\) is \(\frac{1}{4}\), which is confirmed by the Python code calculation.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}
\]

How many different triangles can be formed using three vertices of a hexagon as vertices of a triangle? [asy]size(75);
draw(dir(0)--dir(30)--dir(110)--dir(175)--dir(250)--dir(300)--cycle);
[/asy] Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] To determine how many different triangles can be formed using three vertices of a hexagon, we need to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 6. This is a combinatorial problem and can be solved using the binomial coefficient, which is given by the formula:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

In this case, \( n = 6 \) (the number of vertices in the hexagon) and \( k = 3 \) (the number of vertices needed to form a triangle). So we need to calculate \(\binom{6}{3}\).

Let's calculate this using Python.
```python
import math

# Number of vertices in the hexagon
n = 6
# Number of vertices needed to form a triangle
k = 3

# Calculate the number of different triangles
num_triangles = math.comb(n, k)
print(num_triangles)
```
```output
20
```
The number of different triangles that can be formed using three vertices of a hexagon is \(\boxed{20}\).

A regular pentagon is rotated counterclockwise about its center. What is the minimum number of degrees it must be rotated until it coincides with its original position? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center until it coincides with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon.

A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5. This means that it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \) and still look the same. Therefore, the minimum number of degrees it must be rotated until it coincides with its original position is \( 72^\circ \).

Let's confirm this with a simple Python code snippet to ensure accuracy.
```python
# Calculate the minimum rotation angle for a regular pentagon
order_of_symmetry = 5
minimum_rotation_angle = 360 / order_of_symmetry
print(minimum_rotation_angle)
```
```output
72.0

The minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center until it coincides with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).

Compute $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{n}{n^4+n^2+1}.$$ Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] To solve the infinite series \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{n}{n^4 + n^2 + 1}\), we need to analyze the series and find a way to simplify it. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Simplify the General Term:**
   The general term of the series is \(\frac{n}{n^4 + n^2 + 1}\). We can try to decompose this term into partial fractions or look for a telescoping pattern.

2. **Partial Fraction Decomposition:**
   Let's try to decompose \(\frac{n}{n^4 + n^2 + 1}\) into partial fractions. First, we need to factor the denominator \(n^4 + n^2 + 1\).

   Notice that:
   \[
   n^4 + n^2 + 1 = (n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{n}{n^4 + n^2 + 1} = \frac{n}{(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)}
   \]
   We can use partial fraction decomposition to write this as:
   \[
   \frac{n}{(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)} = \frac{A n + B}{n^2 + n + 1} + \frac{C n + D}{n^2 - n + 1}
   \]
   By solving for \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we find that:
   \[
   \frac{n}{(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)} = \frac{1/2}{n^2 - n + 1} - \frac{1/2}{n^2 + n + 1}
   \]
   So, the series becomes:
   \[
   \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1/2}{n^2 - n + 1} - \frac{1/2}{n^2 + n + 1} \right)
   \]

3. **Telescoping Series:**
   Notice that this is a telescoping series. When we write out the first few terms, we see:
   \[
   \left( \frac{1/2}{0^2 - 0 + 1} - \frac{1/2}{0^2 + 0 + 1} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{1^2 - 1 + 1} - \frac{1/2}{1^2 + 1 + 1} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{2^2 - 2 + 1} - \frac{1/2}{2^2 + 2 + 1} \right) + \cdots
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \left( \frac{1/2}{1} - \frac{1/2}{1} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{1} - \frac{1/2}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{1/2}{3} - \frac{1/2}{7} \right) + \cdots
   \]
   We can see that most terms cancel out, leaving us with:
   \[
   \frac{1/2}{1} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

So, the sum of the series is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).

Let's confirm this with Python and sympy:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
n = sp.symbols('n')

# Define the general term of the series
term = n / (n**4 + n**2 + 1)

# Compute the sum of the series
infinite_sum = sp.summation(term, (n, 0, sp.oo))
print(infinite_sum)

What is the greatest whole number that MUST be a factor of the sum of any four consecutive positive odd numbers? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] To solve this problem, we need to find the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any four consecutive positive odd numbers. Let's break it down:

1. **Define the four consecutive odd numbers:**
   Let the four consecutive odd numbers be \(2n+1\), \(2n+3\), \(2n+5\), and \(2n+7\), where \(n\) is a non-negative integer.

2. **Calculate the sum of these four consecutive odd numbers:**
   \[
   (2n+1) + (2n+3) + (2n+5) + (2n+7) = 8n + 16
   \]

3. **Factor out the greatest common factor:**
   \[
   8n + 16 = 8(n + 2)
   \]
   This shows that the sum of any four consecutive odd numbers is always a multiple of 8.

4. **Check if there is a greater factor:**
   We need to check if there is any number greater than 8 that must be a factor of the sum of any four consecutive odd numbers. To do this, we can check the sum for different values of \(n\) and see if there is a common factor greater than 8.

Let's write the Python code to verify this:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
n = sp.symbols('n')

# Define the sum of four consecutive odd numbers
sum_of_odds = 8*n + 16

# Factor the expression
factored_sum = sp.factor(sum_of_odds)

# Check the greatest common factor
greatest_factor = sp.gcd(factored_sum, sum_of_odds.subs(n, 0))

print(factored_sum)
print(greatest_factor)
```
```output
8*n + 16
8
```
The output confirms that the sum of any four consecutive odd numbers is \(8(n + 2)\), and the greatest common factor of this expression is 8. This means that 8 is the greatest whole number that must be a factor of the sum of any four consecutive positive odd numbers.

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{8}\).

Simplify the fraction $\frac{27}{30}$. Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] To simplify the fraction \(\frac{27}{30}\), we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 27 and 30, and then divide both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD.

The steps are as follows:

1. Find the GCD of 27 and 30.
2. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the GCD.
3. Output the simplified fraction.

Let's use Python to perform these steps.
```python
import math

# Define the numerator and denominator
numerator = 27
denominator = 30

# Find the greatest common divisor (GCD)
gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)

# Simplify the fraction
simplified_numerator = numerator // gcd
simplified_denominator = denominator // gcd

simplified_fraction = (simplified_numerator, simplified_denominator)
print(simplified_fraction)
```
```output
(9, 10)
```
The simplified form of the fraction \(\frac{27}{30}\) is \(\frac{9}{10}\).

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{10}}\).

Find the volume of the tetrahedron whose vertices are $A = (0,1,2),$ $B = (3,0,1),$ $C = (4,3,6),$ and $D = (2,3,2).$ Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.

[response] To find the volume of the tetrahedron with vertices \(A = (0,1,2)\), \(B = (3,0,1)\), \(C = (4,3,6)\), and \(D = (2,3,2)\), we can use the following formula for the volume \(V\) of a tetrahedron with vertices \(\mathbf{A}\), \(\mathbf{B}\), \(\mathbf{C}\), and \(\mathbf{D}\):

\[ V = \frac{1}{6} \left| \mathbf{AB} \cdot (\mathbf{AC} \times \mathbf{AD}) \right| \]

where \(\mathbf{AB} = B - A\), \(\mathbf{AC} = C - A\), and \(\mathbf{AD} = D - A\).

First, we need to find the vectors \(\mathbf{AB}\), \(\mathbf{AC}\), and \(\mathbf{AD}\):

\[
\mathbf{AB} = (3-0, 0-1, 1-2) = (3, -1, -1)
\]
\[
\mathbf{AC} = (4-0, 3-1, 6-2) = (4, 2, 4)
\]
\[
\mathbf{AD} = (2-0, 3-1, 2-2) = (2, 2, 0)
\]

Next, we need to find the cross product \(\mathbf{AC} \times \mathbf{AD}\):

\[
\mathbf{AC} \times \mathbf{AD} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
4 & 2 & 4 \\
2 & 2 & 0
\end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 0 - 4 \cdot 2) - \mathbf{j}(4 \cdot 0 - 4 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(4 \cdot 2 - 2 \cdot 2) = \mathbf{i}(-8) - \mathbf{j}(-8) + \mathbf{k}(4) = (-8, 8, 4)
\]

Now, we need to find the dot product \(\mathbf{AB} \cdot (\mathbf{AC} \times \mathbf{AD})\):

\[
\mathbf{AB} \cdot (-8, 8, 4) = 3 \cdot (-8) + (-1) \cdot 8 + (-1) \cdot 4 = -24 - 8 - 4 = -36
\]

Finally, the volume of the tetrahedron is:

\[
V = \frac{1}{6} \left| -36 \right| = \frac{1}{6} \cdot 36 = 6
\]

Let's confirm this with Python code.
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the vertices
A = np.array([0, 1, 2])
B = np.array([3, 0, 1])
C = np.array([4, 3, 6])
D = np.array([2, 3, 2])

# Calculate the vectors AB, AC, AD
AB = B - A
AC = C - A
AD = D - A

# Calculate the cross product AC x AD
cross_product = np.cross(AC, AD)

# Calculate the dot product AB . (AC x AD)
dot_product = np.dot(AB, cross_product)

# Calculate the volume of the tetrahedron
volume = abs(dot_product) / 6
print(volume)
```
```output
6.0
```
The volume of the tetrahedron with vertices \(A = (0,1,2)\), \(B = (3,0,1)\), \(C = (4,3,6)\), and \(D = (2,3,2)\) is \(\boxed{6}\).
