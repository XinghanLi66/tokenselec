How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have? Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] To determine the number of vertical asymptotes of the function \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \), we need to identify the values of \( x \) that make the denominator equal to zero. These values will give us the locations of the vertical asymptotes.

The steps are as follows:

1. Factor the denominator \( x^2 + x - 6 \).
2. Set the factored denominator equal to zero and solve for \( x \).
3. Count the number of distinct solutions to determine the number of vertical asymptotes.

Let's proceed with the Python code to perform these steps.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Define the denominator
denominator = x**2 + x - 6

# Factor the denominator
factored_denominator = sp.factor(denominator)

# Solve for x when the denominator is zero
vertical_asymptotes = sp.solve(factored_denominator, x)

# Count the number of distinct solutions
num_vertical_asymptotes = len(vertical_asymptotes)

# Print the result
print(num_vertical_asymptotes)
```
```output
2
```
The number of vertical asymptotes of the graph of \( y = \frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \) is \(\boxed{2}\).

If $a,b,c,d$ are positive real numbers such that $a,b,c,d$ form an increasing arithmetic sequence and $a,b,d$ form a geometric sequence, then find the value of $\dfrac{a}{d}.$ Let's think step by step and output the final answer within \boxed{}.
assistant

[response] Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define the Arithmetic Sequence:**
   Since \(a, b, c, d\) form an arithmetic sequence, we can write:
   \[
   b = a + d_1, \quad c = a + 2d_1, \quad d = a + 3d_1
   \]
   where \(d_1\) is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence.

2. **Define the Geometric Sequence:**
   Since \(a, b, d\) form a geometric sequence, we can write:
   \[
   b^2 = ad
   \]
   Substituting \(b = a + d_1\) and \(d = a + 3d_1\) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   (a + d_1)^2 = a(a + 3d_1)
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying, we get:
   \[
   a^2 + 2ad_1 + d_1^2 = a^2 + 3ad_1
   \]
   \[
   d_1^2 = ad_1
   \]
   Since \(d_1 \neq 0\) (because \(a, b, c, d\) are positive real numbers), we can divide both sides by \(d_1\):
   \[
   d_1 = a
   \]
   So, the common difference \(d_1\) is equal to \(a\).

3. **Find the Value of \(\frac{a}{d}\):**
   Since \(d = a + 3d_1\) and \(d_1 = a\), we have:
   \[
   d = a + 3a = 4a
   \]
   Therefore, the value of \(\frac{a}{d}\) is:
   \[
   \frac{a}{d} = \frac{a}{4a} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

Let's confirm this with Python code to ensure the result is accurate.
```python
# Let's define the variables and solve the equations step by step using Python

# Since a, b, c, d form an arithmetic sequence, we can write:
# b = a + d1, c = a + 2d1, d = a + 3d1
# Since a, b, d form a geometric sequence, we can write:
# b^2 = ad

# Substituting b = a + d1 and d = a + 3d1 into the geometric sequence equation:
# (a + d1)^2 = a(a + 3d1)
# Expanding and simplifying:
# a^2 + 2ad1 + d1^2 = a^2 + 3ad1
# d1^2 = ad1
# Since d1 != 0, we can divide both sides by d1:
# d1 = a

# So, the common difference d1 is equal to a.
# Therefore, d = a + 3d1 = a + 3a = 4a
# The value of a/d is:
# a/d = a/(4a) = 1/4

# Let's confirm this with a simple calculation
a = 1  # We can assume a to be any positive real number, let's assume a = 1 for simplicity
d = 4 * a  # Since d = 4a
a_over_d = a / d  # The value of a/d

print(a_over_d)
```
```output
0.25
```
The value of \(\frac{a}{d}\) is \(\frac{1}{4}\), which is confirmed by the Python code calculation.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}
\]
